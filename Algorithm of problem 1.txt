Algorithm
Step 1 :-
Enter three numerical values
Expected Result: User should be able to enter 3 numerical values

Step 2 :-
Create a dictonary and array
Expected Result: dictonary, array should be created

Step 3 :-
Assign the arithmetic operations of entered numerical values to the dictonaries keys
Expected Result: Arithmetic operation's result should be stored in dictonary

Step 4 :-
Assign the dictonaries values to the arrays
Expected Result: Dictonaries values should be stored in the arrays indexes

Step 5 :-
Print the values of the arrays to check the values stored in the array
Expected result: values of the array should be printed

Step 6 :-
Use switch case to perform ascending or descending sorting of the array values.
Expected result: a choice should be given to user to select the option of ascending or descending sorting

Step 7:-
If option of ascending is selected, create 2 for loop to iterate the array,as in first loop, start transverse from i=0 index and in 2nd loop, start transverse from i +1 index and follow the if else condition.
Expected result: transversing through the array should be there and follow the below criteria:-
for all array elements  
      if arr[i] > arr[i+1]  
         swap(arr[i], arr[i+1])  
      end if  
   end for     
   return arr
Step 8:-
If option of descending is selected, create 2 for loop to iterate the array,as in first loop, start transverse from i=0 index and in 2nd loop, start transverse from i +1 index and follow the if else condition.
Expected result: transversing through the array should be there and follow the below criteria:-
for all array elements  
      if arr[i] < arr[i+1]  
         swap(arr[i], arr[i+1])  
      end if  
   end for     
   return arr
Step 9:
If none of the option is selected, then program will end
Expected result: If 1 or 2 number is not entered, exit will print and program will exit.
