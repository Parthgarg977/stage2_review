Algorithm
Step 1 :-
Create three variables with 0 value with 2 variables to keep track of wins of heads and tails, 3rd variable is used in while loop.
Expected result: head_win, tail_win, i variables are created

Step 2 :-
A while loop is created

Step 3 :- 
In while loop, random variable modulus by 2 to generate 1 or 0 values are stored in a variable toss_win
Expected result:- toss_result= ((RANDOM%2))

Step 4:-
If random value is 1 value, then go inside if condition of toss_win -eq 1
Expected result: print heads text and increment the head_win variable

Step 5:-
If random value is 0 value, then go inside if condition of toss_win -eq 0
Expected result: print tails text and increment the tail_win variable

Step 6:-
While loop continue to run, until head_win or tail_win reaches a value of 21, loop will go inside
Expected result: Loop will break

Step 7:-
Outside the loop, if head_win is greater than tail_win,
Expected result: print "Its win for head by" and head_win value

Step 8:-
Outside the loop, if head_win is not greater than tail_win,
Expected result: print "Its win for tail by" and tail
_win value
